# Dynamic Grid Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `StageManager` class to orchestrate mark entry and exit. When you click on the canvas, a square mark is animated in or out at that position in a grid. The color of the mark is chosen randomly when the mark is first created, allowing you to see that marks are reused if you click twice in the same position (hide, then show again).

## Setup

```bash
cd tests/dynamic_grid
npm install
npm run dev
```
