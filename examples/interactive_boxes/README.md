# Interactive Boxes Example

This example shows how to use a `PositionMap` to quickly find marks under the
user's pointer. In the demo, you can click and drag nodes to move them around,
and the node appearance animates to show hover and drag states.

## Setup

To run this example locally, first install the local Counterpoint version:

```bash
cd counterpoint && npm install && cd ..
```
