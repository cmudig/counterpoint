# Scatterplot Example

This example shows how to use a `PositionMap` to quickly find marks under the
user's pointer. In the demo, you can click and drag nodes to move them around,
and the node appearance animates to show hover and drag states.

## Setup

```bash
cd examples/interactive_boxes
npm install
npm run dev
```
